    <ul id="recepieList">
        <li>800 g ground beef (or ground lamb)</li>
        <li>4 potatoes</li>
        <li>2 eggplants</li>
        <li> 2 onions , diced</li>
        <li>400 ml extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic , crushed</li>
        <li>150 ml red wine</li>
        <li>½ bunch parsley , finely chopped</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
      
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Preperation:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Peel potatoes and cut them into ¼ inch (5mm) slices.</li>
      <li>Slice off stalk and bottom ends of eggplant. Cut them lengthwise into ¼ inch (5mm) slices.</li>
      <li>Place eggplant slices in a large bowl filled with salty water and leave to soak for 30 minutes, then remove eggplant from water and leave to dry well on paper towel.</li>
      <li>Over medium heat, add ¼ cup (100ml) of olive oil to a large frying pan and fry the sliced potato in batches. Make sure to turn them over to cook both sides. The potato slices should be fried until slightly soft, about 4-5 minutes on each side.</li>
      <li>When the potato slices are cooked, remove from the hot oil and place them on paper towels.</li>
      <li>In the same frying pan, add ¼ cup (100ml) of olive oil and over a medium heat, start frying the eggplant slices in batches, adding olive oil regularly.</li>
      <li>Remove each batch from the hot oil and place them on spread paper towels.</li>
      <li>In the same pan, add ¼ cup (100ml) oil and sauté the diced onion until translucent. Add ground meat to the onions in the frying pan and mix well to break up the meat.</li>
      <li>Stir meat continuously over medium-high heat for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add red wine, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper to the pan and stir well to mix.</li>
      <li>Dilute tomato paste in ½ cup (100ml) of water and add to pan.</li>
      <li>Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until liquid is entirely reduced.</li>
      <li>Grease the sides and bottoms of a baking pan with olive oil.</li>
      <li>Cover the bottom completely with a layer of potato slices by overlapping where necessary to ensure a complete covering. Cover with a layer of eggplant slices.</li>
      <li>Spoon out a little more than half of the meat mixture and spread to cover the bottom layers evenly.</li>
      <li>Cover meat layer with remaining potato slices, then cover completely with another layer of eggplant slices, overlapping as necessary to ensure complete coverage.</li>
      <li>Spread remaining meat mixture out evenly to cover the eggplant layer. Using a spatula, press down gently on the layers to compact them</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Preperation of the White Sauce:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt butter in a medium sized saucepan over a medium-low heat.</li>
      <li>When butter is melted, thoroughly incorporate the flour in stages using a whisk and continuously stirring for about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Once the flour is fully incorporated, gradually add the 4 cups (1l) of milk while stirring continuously. Turn up the heat slightly to bring the thick sauce to a boil and then remove the saucepan from the heat.</li>
      <li>Add nutmeg, salt and pepper and mix sauce well.</li>
      <li>Add egg yolks slowly to the sauce, making sure to combine well.</li>
      <li>Pour a thick layer of white sauce into baking pan to completely cover the top meat sauce layer. Spread white sauce evenly to ensure a uniform surface.</li>
      <li>Place baking pan into an oven preheated to 350F/80C, and bake for 40 minutes or until the top is nicely browned.</li>
